For the first time in my life, I'm trying to write a blog. This is both exciting and scary. I chose github.io because I like github and well, it's free. Since I plan to write some fairly mathy stuff, I have also set up Mathjax, which took a while.

The result:
$$
x_i + y_i = z_i
$$

To setup Mathjax, [this page](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) is a good place to get started.

I'm still going through [Jekyll Quickstart](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html).
