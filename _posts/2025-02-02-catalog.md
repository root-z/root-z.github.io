Iceberg is a data lake table format that is getting mainstream adoption. Iceberg utilizes a [catalog](https://iceberg.apache.org/concepts/catalog/) to store table metadata. The idea is that iceberg specifies how to organize the data within a table, but you need a catalog to store a list of all the tables you have and where each table is located.

The key data in the catalog is a pointer to the latest Iceberg metadata file.

Iceberg supports arbitrary catalog backend that implements the Catalog [interface](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/api/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/catalog/Catalog.java) such as Rest Catalog, Glue Catalog or even [S3-tables-catalog](https://github.com/awslabs/s3-tables-catalog). There is also an [OpenAPI](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml) spec for the REST catalog. 

An advantage of iceberg is that it's possible to migrate the catalog metadata without touching the actual iceberg data. Project Nessie provided a [migration tool](https://github.com/projectnessie/iceberg-catalog-migrator) for doing just that.
